        <div><h5>Drugs and alcohol can be hard subjects to discuss, especially if you think your friend or relative has a problem.

            Try to stay open-minded and remember that, with the right help and support, most people overcome their use before any serious harm is caused. Also, even if you do offer support, they might not change their behaviour.

            <h3>How can I stop my friend taking lots of drugs or alcohol?</h3>
          <p>You can’t force your friend to do anything they don’t want to do, but you still might be able to help.

            Start by encouraging your friend to stay away from the places where they’d normally take drugs or drink alcohol (like the pub or a mate’s house), and suggest other activities.
            
            You can also remind your friend of the potential dangers involved in taking lots of drugs or drinking lots of alcohol and tell them where they can get accurate information about what they’re using. Whatever happens, make sure your friend knows you’re around and happy to talk – that you’re there to help and not judge.
            
          </p><h3>What should I do?</h3> <p>
            Worrying about a friend’s drug or alcohol use is stressful, and how you choose to deal with it is up to you. You might try to help your friend, you might decide to put up with it and not say much, or you might decide to step back and not offer much support.
            
            There are pros and cons to each of these choices, and it’s essential you think of your own wellbeing when you decide on which approach to take. It may be that you need support and/or professional help yourself too.

            <h3>Starting a conversation about drugs or alcohol</h3>
          <p>It’s important to stay calm and open-minded when you talk to your child about drugs or alcohol. Remember to look at the FRANK A-Z of drugs to make sure your knowledge is up-to-date and accurate, and think about how you’ll react if your child says he/she has tried drugs or alcohol. You don’t want to react in a way that shuts down the conversation.

            Once you’re ready to chat, make sure you:
            
            Keep the subject broad to begin with, ask open-ended questions about your child’s friends and school. An open-ended question is one where the person can’t answer with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. For example, “What was today like at school?” or “Why do you think people take drugs or drink alcohol?”.
            Allow plenty of time, don’t rush the conversation.
            Listen carefully and keep the chat as two-way as possible.
            Be understanding – not judgmental or critical.
            Respect what they have to say – don’t lose your temper if you disagree with your child’s opinions, it might make them rebel more.
            Don’t make assumptions about what they know or do, and don’t accuse your child of taking drugs or drinking alcohol (even if you think they have).
            Let them know you’re there for them – that they can talk to you about drugs or alcohol.
            Set boundaries, make it clear what your house rules are so they know what you will and won’t accept.
            Be realistic: while there are some serious risks involved in drug and alcohol use, most people who try drugs or alcohol don’t suffer any long-term harm to their health.
            And if they are using or drinking, don’t confront them when they’re high or drunk.
            If your child refuses to talk to you, try not to panic. Remember that people who try drugs or alcohol often don’t carry on using them. Support them to talk to another adult such as a school nurse, GP, youth worker or a specialist service.
            
          </p><h3>What should I do?</h3><p>
            You can help your child by speaking to them about drugs or alcohol and offering them your support.
            
            Worrying about a child’s drug or alcohol use is stressful, and if your child has a problem it may be that you need support and/or professional help yourself too.

          <span class="plus-minus-toggle"></span> Feeling pressured to take drugs? Here are 10 ways to deal with it  
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>1.Remember that you’re not alone. It’s easy to think you’re the only one who’s not tried drugs but, actually, most young people don’t take drugs.

          </p><p>  2. Work out where you stand on issues like sex, drugs and alcohol. Knowing your own mind makes it easier to stay true to yourself.
            
          </p><p></p> 3. Prepare yourself. Think about how you’d like to respond when someone offers you drugs so you know what to say.
            
        <p>4. Try to understand who’s offering you the drugs and why. Friends should understand if you say no, people you don’t know you very well may expect something in return.
            
        </p><p> 5. Say no firmly but clearly and without making a big deal about it. If they try to persuade you, don’t feel like you have to change your mind.
            
        </p><p> 6.Remember that, although they may not show it, your mates will respect you more if you’re assertive and clear about what you do and don’t want to do.
            
        </p><p> 7.Take a look around. You’ll soon see that you’re not the only one worrying about what other people think of you. Try to focus on your own opinion of yourself - in the end, that’s all that matters.
            
        </p><p> 8.Worried about your mates being pressured? Don’t keep it to yourself, talk to them, or someone you trust.
            
        </p><p> 9. If you’re finding it hard to be yourself within your group, take a step back, and think about whether it’s time to find a new crowd to hang out with.
            
        </p><p>  10. Before trying anything new it makes sense to know what’s what. You can  call on 0800 080 999 at any time, day or night.</p>

          <span class="plus-minus-toggle"></span> What to do in an emergency
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            If you're with someone who needs medical help, call an ambulance and tell the crew everything you know about the drugs taken, it could save their life. If you have any drugs left, hand them over to the crew as it may help. In most circumstances they won't tell the police.
          </p>
          <p>Most people don’t use drugs and even among those that do, emergencies are rare. But no one can be certain how drugs will affect them so there’s always the risk they’ll have a bad time, fall ill, hurt themselves or even worse.

            Should you ever need to help someone who’s having a bad reaction, here’s what you need to know:
        </p><h3>What to look out for</h3><p>If someone is having a bad time on drugs they may be: anxious
            
            ,tense,
            
            panicky,
            
            overheated and dehydrated,
            
            drowsy,
            
            having difficulty with breathing.</p><h3>What to do</h3><p>
                </p><h4>The first things you should do are:</h4><p>
            stay calm , calm them and be reassuring - don’t scare them or chase after them ,try to find out what they’ve taken, stay with them.

</p><h4>If they are anxious, tense or panicky you should:</h4><p>
sit them in a quiet and calm room

keep them away from crowds, bright lights and loud noises

tell them to take slow deep breaths

stay with them

</p><h4>If they are really drowsy you should:</h4><p>
sit them in a quiet place and keep them awake

if they don’t respond or become unconscious call an ambulance immediately and place them in the recovery position

don’t scare them, shout at them or shock them

don’t give them coffee to wake them up

don’t put them in a cold bath to “wake them up” – this wastes time and there’s a risk of drowning

</p><h4>If they are unconscious or having difficulty breathing you should:</h4><p>
Immediately phone for an ambulance

Place them into the recovery position

Stay with them until the ambulance arrives

If you know what drug they’ve taken tell the ambulance crew immediately, it might them get the right treatment faster

          <span class="plus-minus-toggle"></span> What is drug and alcohol treatment like?

        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
           <p> Drug or alcohol treatment can seem like a big step, but much like any other treatment, there are 5 steps to getting help.

            Here’s a guide to what to expect, and the different treatments available.
            
           </p><h3>Step 1: You notice something’s wrong</h3><p>
            You may have realised that you’re not in full control of your drug or alcohol use and that it’s causing problems. These problems might involve money, strained friendships, broken relationships, your job, or getting arrested.
            
            If you’re developing a problem with prescribed or over-the-counter medicines, you may find you’ve been hiding the amount you’re taking or lying about your symptoms.
            
        </p><h3> Step 2: You go to get expert help</h3>
            There are two main ways you can find treatment:
            
            <h4>Through your GP</h4>
            Your GP refers you to a treatment service.
            
           <h4> Self-referral</h4> 
            Details of treatment services are available online, from your local NHS services and in the phone book. FRANK also has a directory of treatment services.
            
            You can also call the FRANK helpline and talk confidentially to one of our advisors.
            
        <h3>   Step 3: You’re assessed</h3><p>
            Before treatment can start, you’ll need to discuss your drug or alcohol use with a doctor, other health professionals or a trained drug and alcohol worker.
            
            They will let you know what treatment options are available for your drug or alcohol use and any other health problems you may have. Your personal care plan will then be developed with you.
            
            This care plan normally details your immediate and longer-term treatment goals and is intended to be updated throughout your time in treatment as your needs and circumstances change.
            
        </p><h3>     Step 4: A course of treatment is discussed with you</h3><p></p>
            Your treatment journey should be tailored to your circumstances and needs, but most treatment involves some form of talking therapy.
            
            Prescribed medication is also needed for certain drug or alcohol problems. See Step 5 for more information on different types of treatment.
            
        <h3>   Step 5: You change your lifestyle</h3><p></p>
            Recovery from a drug or alcohol problem often involves a long-term lifestyle change. A number of social factors can help you not to use drugs or alcohol (called abstinence) or to cut down and can help you achieve an improved quality of life.
            
            <h4>These include:</h4>
            
          <p> - having stable accommodation</p>
          <p> - developing a new network of non-drug or alcohol using friends or friends who only drink in moderation</p>
          <p> - re-engaging in education or work</p>
          <p> - getting support from others who have had similar problems  </p>
